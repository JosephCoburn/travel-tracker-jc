#### Technologies Used:
*Mongoose, Express, React, Node, Heroku, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Git, GitHub*

#### Getting Started

*Click 'Login' to begin. Enter an email and password. You will not be sent any emails whatsoever from this. In fact, it doesn't even have to be a real email address. Just input something you'll remember. After Signup, you will automatically be logged in with that account. Click 'Add Voyage' on the navigation bar to start using the app! When inputting information, remember that the only required fields are 'Date', 'Region', 'Country', and 'Destination'.* 

**IMPORTANT!** *In order to use the sort functionality, users must input location properties (region, country, state/territory) EXACTLY as they'd be found on an atlas. For example, 'United States' MUST be input as 'United States'. If it is entered as 'united states', 'US of A', 'Unied States' ... etc, the sort functionality will not work. *

**

*Click 'Sign Up' to continue. No email address is required. After the account is created, start by either adding a match or creating your profile. To add a match, simply click the button displayed. To create your profile, click the navigation button in the top right corner, then click the grey avatar and 'Create Profile'. After adding at least one match, users can create rendezvous by clicking 'Add Rendezvous' from the navigation bar or from a match's detail page. Once a rendezvous is scheduled, users can view the rendezvous details and send them to their Google Calendar by clicking the button from the rendezvous details page. To get date suggestions from yelp, be sure that the scheduled rendezvous contains both an activity and location, then simply click 'Search Yelp For Ideas'. If a match ghosts you, indicate this by clicking the 'Ghosted' button from the match's details page.*
